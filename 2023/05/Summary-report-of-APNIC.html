                                        <p>There was a Panel discussion on the Leasing of IP addresses. The existing
                                            APNIC policies are silent on leasing, and there was a policy in APNIC 54 on
                                            leasing (which was held in Singapore in September 2022), ‘prop-148: Leasing
                                            of Resources is not Acceptable’, which didn’t reach a consensus. Leasing is
                                            a tricky point as ISPs, network services providers and other organizations
                                            use IP addresses outside their ASN boundary also for multiple reasons, and a
                                            negative policy on this can lead to chaos for a few networks/organizations.

                                    What is Wi-Fi?
                                </p>

                                <p><br /><br />Wi-Fi is the name of a popular wireless networking technology that uses
                                    radio waves to provide wireless high-speed Internet and network connections.</p>

                                <p>Wireless networks operate using radio frequency (RF) technology, a frequency within
                                    the electromagnetic spectrum associated with radio wave propagation. When an RF
                                    current is supplied to an antenna, an electromagnetic field is created that then is
                                    able to propagate through space.
                                </p>

                                <p>The cornerstone of a wireless network is a device known as an access point (AP). The
                                    primary job of an access point is to broadcast a wireless signal that computers can
                                    detect and "tune" into.</p>

                                <p>The radios used for Wi-Fi communication are very similar to the radios used for
                                    walkie-talkies, cell phones and other devices. They can transmit and receive radio
                                    waves, and they can convert 1s and 0s into radio waves and convert the radio waves
                                    back into 1s and 0s.</p>

                                <p><u>But Wi-Fi radios have a few notable differences from other radios:</u></p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>They transmit at
                                        frequencies of 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz. This frequency is considerably higher than the
                                        frequencies used for cell phones, walkie-talkies and televisions. The higher
                                        frequency allows the signal to carry more data.</li>
                                    <li>They use 802.11
                                        networking standards, which come in several flavors:</li>
                                    <li><b>802.11a</b>&nbsp;transmits at 5 GHz and can move up to 54
                                        megabits of data per second. It also uses <b>orthogonal frequency-division
                                            multiplexing</b>&nbsp;(OFDM), a more efficient coding technique that splits
                                        that radio signals into several sub-signals before they reach a receiver. This
                                        greatly reduces interference.</li>
                                    <li><b>802.11b</b>&nbsp;is the slowest and least expensive
                                        standard. For a while, its cost made it popular, but now it's becoming less
                                        common as faster standards become less expensive. 802.11b transmits in the 2.4
                                        GHz frequency band of the radio spectrum. It can handle up to 11 megabits of
                                        data per second, and it uses <b>complementary code keying</b>&nbsp;(CCK)
                                        modulation to improve speeds.</li>
                                    <li><b>802.11g</b>&nbsp;transmits at 2.4 GHz like 802.11b, but
                                        it's a lot faster -- it can handle up to 54 megabits of data per second.
                                        802.11g is faster because it uses the same OFDM coding as 802.11a.</li>
                                    <li><b>802.11n</b>&nbsp;is the most widely available of the
                                        standards and is backward compatible with a, b and g. It significantly improved
                                        speed and range over its predecessors. For instance, although 802.11g
                                        theoretically moves 54 megabits of data per second, it only achieves real-world
                                        speeds of about 24 megabits of data per second because of network congestion.
                                        802.11n, however, reportedly can achieve speeds as high as 140 megabits per
                                        second. 802.11n can transmit up to four streams of data, each at a maximum of
                                        150 megabits per second, but most routers only allow for two or three streams.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>802.11ac</b>&nbsp;is the newest standard as of early 2013.
                                        It has yet to be widely adopted, and is still in draft form at
                                        the&nbsp;<b>Institute
                                            of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</b>, but devices that support
                                        it
                                        are already on the market. 802.11ac is backward compatible with 802.11n (and
                                        therefore the others, too), with n on the 2.4 GHz band and ac on the 5 GHz
                                        band. It is less prone to interference and far faster than its predecessors,
                                        pushing a maximum of 450 megabits per second on a single stream, although
                                        real-world
                                        speeds may be lower. Like 802.11n, it allows for transmission on multiple
                                        spatial streams -- up to eight, optionally. It is sometimes called&nbsp;<b>5G
                                            Wi-Fi</b>&nbsp;because of its frequency band, sometimes&nbsp;<b>Gigabit
                                            Wi-Fi</b>&nbsp;because
                                        of its potential to exceed a gigabit per second on multiple streams and
                                        sometimes&nbsp;<b>Very High Throughput (VHT)</b>&nbsp;for the same reason.</li>
                                    <li>Other 802.11 standards
                                        focus on specific applications of wireless networks, like wide area networks
                                        (WANs) inside vehicles or technology that lets you move from one wireless
                                        network to another seamlessly.</li>
                                    <li>Wi-Fi radios can
                                        transmit on any of three frequency bands. Or, they can "frequency
                                        hop" rapidly between the different bands. Frequency hopping helps reduce
                                        interference and lets multiple devices use the same wireless connection
                                        simultaneously.</li>
                                </ul>

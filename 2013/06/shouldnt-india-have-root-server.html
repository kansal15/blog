                                    A Root name server is a name server for DNS root zone. Every new DNS query resolved
                                    by our local resolver first goes to Root Name Server and then root name server
                                    directs it to required domain server.

                                </p>

                                <p>This means that if in any case, root name servers goes down, then whole internet goes
                                    down (don't worry this cannot be done so easily as most of root name servers are
                                    running on Anycast and located all over the world). Recently, an anonymous group
                                    posted, to target these 13 root name severs and to bring them down by DDOS attack on
                                    31st March 2011, to protest against SOPA and PIPA. But as expected, they didn't
                                    succeed. The last time someone seriously tried to take out the root servers was
                                    about 4 or 5 years ago and they managed to take down six out of thirteen servers. I
                                    am not saying that it could not be done but it would be tough.</p>

                                <p>Every root name server is operated by different organization (except 'A' and 'J'
                                    which are operated by VeriSign) but they all point to 'A' root name server.</p>

                                <p>If any change needs to be done on root zone, it has to be done on 'A' and then all
                                    root name server will update its zone file through 'A'.</p>

                                <p>This creates a tricky situation because if the controllers of the root name servers
                                    decides to block any particular zone Or if they are forced to do so (may be in case
                                    of cyber-attack against any country or any similar situation), then that particular
                                    zone will be out of the whole internet.
                                </p>

                                <p>Currently, there are 13 root name servers. The choice of 13 nameserver was due to the
                                    limitation exists in the DNS specification, which specifies a maximum packet size of
                                    512 bytes when using UDP.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Root name severs are named in the form of letter.root-servers.net, where letter
                                    ranges from A to M.</p>

                                <p>Out of 13 root name serves, 9 are running on Anycast. 2 root name servers are
                                    operated by U.S. Universities.</p>

                                <p>'B' operated by Information Sciences Institute of University of Southern California
                                    and 'D' operated by University of Maryland.</p>

                                <p>After the implementation of DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) and addition of IPv6
                                    addresses for the root nameservers, 512 bytes limit doesn't remains valid and EDNS0
                                    extension was added to DNS standard.</p>

                                <p>Now as previously exists limitation doesn't exist anymore, new root name servers can
                                    be granted by IANA.</p>

                                <p>There are approx. 2.27 billion internet users all over the world out of which 1
                                    billion are in ASIA. And if figure out country-wise internet users, India has
                                    approximately 120 million internet users and china has 513 million internet users.
                                    On combining both of these, it comes out 633 million internet users, which is 28% of
                                    total internet users.</p>

                                <p>But the irony is, there are no Root name servers operated by any of these countries.
                                    Now the million dollar question is, shouldn't the IANA allocate new Root name
                                    servers as the limitation doesn't exist anymore after the EDNS0 extension to the DNS
                                    standards.</p>

                                <p>There are many things that goes against china, some are, it filters internet traffic
                                    and this is against the whole concept of internet itself, government influence over
                                    the internet and unpredictable behavior of government. so may be internet community
                                    shows reluctance in allocating new root name server to china.</p>

                                <p>But if we talk about India, it is the largest democracy of the world, a secular and
                                    sovereign country, has stable government since independence, ninth largest in the
                                    world by GDP, so it is the safe bet for allocation of new Root Name Server.</p>

                                <p>Shouldn't be IANA look into this and tries to decrease the internet infrastructure
                                    difference which exists between the North and the South????</p>

                                    The extra latency and computational costs of the full TLS handshake impose a serious
                                    performance penalty on all applications that require secure communication. To help
                                    mitigate some of the costs, TLS provides an ability to resume or share the same
                                    negotiated secret key data between multiple connections.

                                </p>
                                <h6><u>Session Identifiers </u></h6>
                                <p>The first Session Identifiers (RFC 5246) resumption mechanism was introduced in SSL
                                    2.0, which allowed the server to create and send a 32-byte session identifier as
                                    part of its "ServerHello" message during the full TLS negotiation which we discuss
                                    in TLS Handshake. </p>
                                <p>
                                    Internally, the server could then maintain a cache of session IDs and the negotiated
                                    session parameters for each peer. In turn, the client could then also store the
                                    session ID information and include the ID in the "ClientHello" message for a
                                    subsequent session, which serves as an indication to the server that the client
                                    still remembers the negotiated cipher suite and keys from previous handshake and is
                                    able to reuse them. Assuming both the client and the server are able to find the
                                    shared session ID parameters in their respective caches, then an abbreviated
                                    handshake can take place. Otherwise, a full new session negotiation is required,
                                    which will generate a new session ID.
                                </p>

                                <p>Leveraging session identifiers allows us to remove a full roundtrip, as well as the
                                    overhead of public key cryptography, which is used to negotiate the shared secret
                                    key. This allows a secure connection to be established quickly and with no loss of
                                    security, since we are reusing the previously negotiated session data.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        In practice, most web applications attempt to establish multiple connections to
                                        the
                                        same host to fetch resources in parallel, which makes session resumption a
                                        must-have
                                        optimisation to reduce latency and computational costs for both sides.

                                    </p>
                                    <p> Most modern browsers intentionally wait for the first TLS connection to complete
                                        before opening new connections to the same server: subsequent TLS connections
                                        can
                                        reuse the SSL session parameters to avoid the costly handshake.</p>



                                </blockquote>
                                <p>However, one of the practical limitations of the Session Identifiers mechanism is the
                                    requirement for the server to create and maintain a session cache for every client.
                                    This results in several problems on the server, which may see tens of thousands or
                                    even millions of unique connections every day: consumed memory for every open TLS
                                    connection, a requirement for session ID cache and eviction policies, and nontrivial
                                    deployment challenges for popular sites with many servers, which should, ideally,
                                    use a shared TLS session cache for best performance.</p>

                                <p>
                                    None of the preceding problems are impossible to solve, and many high-traffic sites
                                    are using session identifiers successfully today. But for any multiserver
                                    deployment, session identifiers will require some careful thinking and systems
                                    architecture to ensure a well operating session cache.
                                </p>

                                <h6><u>Session Tickets</u></h6>
                                <p>To address this concern for server-side deployment of TLS session caches, the
                                    "Session Ticket" (RFC 5077) replacement mechanism was introduced, which removes the
                                    requirement for the server to keep per-client session state. Instead, if the client
                                    indicated that it supports Session Tickets, in the last exchange of the full TLS
                                    handshake, the server can include a New Session Ticket record, which includes all of
                                    the session data encrypted with a secret key known only by the server.</p>
                                <p>This session ticket is then stored by the client and can be included in the
                                    SessionTicket extension within theClientHello message of a subsequent session. Thus,
                                    all session data is stored only on the client, but the ticket is still safe because
                                    it is encrypted with a key known only by the server.</p>
                                <p>The session identifiers and session ticket mechanisms are respectively commonly
                                    referred to as session cachingand stateless resumption mechanisms. The main
                                    improvement of stateless resumption is the removal of the server-side session cache,
                                    which simplifies deployment by requiring that the client provide the session ticket
                                    on every new connection to the server—that is, until the ticket has expired.</p>

                                    SPDY (pronounced as SPeeDY) :-
                                </p><br><br>
                                <p>SPDY is an experimental protocol developed at Google, designed to reduce the latency
                                    of web pages. Specifically, its goal is to address the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and
                                    to remove existing bottlenecks like:-</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>head of line blocking,</li>
                                    <li>inefficient use of underlying TCP connections,</li>
                                    <li>and header bloat</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>SPDY achieves reduced latency through compression, multiplexing, and
                                    prioritisation.<br />
                                    The name "SPDY" is a trademark of Google and is not an acronym.</p>
                                <p>Implementing a new protocol across the web, where varieties of devices exists along
                                    with multiple range of OS across platforms, is like play with fire. This may lead to
                                    random dropped connections with no or very little troubleshooting information and
                                    will cause frustration for the end user. To deal with this, SPDY is delivered via
                                    SSL.
                                    End-to-end encrypted tunnel allows the client and the server to exchange SPDY frames
                                    without intervention by intermediate nodes. It's important to note that SPDY does
                                    not require SSL, but in practice, SSL is a pragmatic choice to get to a working
                                    solution.</p>
                                <p>So, how the client and server will know to use the SPDY after the establishment of
                                    TLS/SSL session ?<br />
                                    Here comes NPN is picture.<br />
                                    Next Protocol Negotiation (NPN) is a TLS extension, which was developed as part of
                                    the SPDY effort at Google to enable efficient application protocol negotiation
                                    during the TLS handshake. </p>
                                <p>The biggest difference between HTTP/1.1 and SPDY, is that each user action in SPDY is
                                    given a "stream ID", meaning there is a single TCP channel connecting the user to
                                    the server. SPDY splits requests into either control or data. SPDY has shown evident
                                    improvement from HTTP, with a new page load speedup ranging from 11.81% to 47.7%.
                                </p>
                                <p>On February 2015, Google had announced that following the final ratification of the
                                    HTTP/2 standard, support for SPDY would be deprecated, and that support for SPDY
                                    will be withdrawn completely in 2016.</p>
                                <h6 class="pt-3"><u>Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN):-</u></h6>
                                <p>ALPN is a revised and IETF approved version of the NPN extension. Application Layer
                                    Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) is a TLS extension that introduces support for
                                    application protocol negotiation into the TLS handshake (please see TLS Handshake
                                    blog), thereby eliminating the need for an extra roundtrip required by the HTTP
                                    Upgrade workflow.
                                </p>
                                <p>Specifically, the process is as follows:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The client appends a new ProtocolNameList field, containing the list of
                                        supported application protocols, into the ClientHello message.</li>
                                    <li>The server inspects the ProtocolNameList field and returns a ProtocolName field
                                        indicating the selected protocol as part of the ServerHello message.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The server may respond with only a single protocol name, and if it does not support
                                    any that the client requests, then it may choose to abort the connection. As a
                                    result, once the TLS handshake is complete, both the secure tunnel is established,
                                    and the client and server are in agreement as to which application protocol will be
                                    used, they can begin communicating immediately.</p>
                                <p>ALPN eliminates the need for the HTTP Upgrade exchange, saving an extra roundtrip of
                                    latency. However, note that the TLS handshake itself still must be performed; hence
                                    ALPN negotiation is not any faster than HTTP Upgrade over an unencrypted channel.
                                    Instead, it ensures that application protocol negotiation over TLS is not any
                                    slower.</p>
                                <p>In NPN, the server advertised which protocols it supports, and the client then chose
                                    and confirmed the protocol whereas in ALPN, this exchange is reversed: the client
                                    now specifies which protocols it supports, and the server then selects and confirms
                                    the protocol. The rationale for the change is that this brings ALPN into closer
                                    alignment with other protocol negotiation standards. In other words, ALPN is a
                                    successor to NPN, and NPN is deprecated. Clients and servers that rely on NPN
                                    negotiation will have to be upgraded to use ALPN instead.</p>

                                <h6 class="pt-3"><u>HTTP/2 :-</u></h6>
                                <p class="mb-4">HTTP/2 (originally named HTTP/2.0) is the second major version of the
                                    HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web. It is based on SPDY. HTTP/2 was
                                    developed by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol working group (httpbis, where bis means
                                    "repeat" or "twice") of the Internet Engineering Task Force. HTTP/2 is the first new
                                    version of HTTP since HTTP 1.1, which was standardised in RFC 2068 in 1997.</p>

                                <blockquote>
                                    <h6 style="color: #d58753;">Why not HTTP/1.2 ?</h6>
                                    <p>To achieve the performance goals set by the HTTP Working Group, HTTP/2 introduces
                                        a new binary framing layer that is not backward compatible with previous
                                        HTTP/1.x servers and clients. Hence the major protocol version increment to
                                        HTTP/2.
                                    </p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>HTTP/2 leaves most of HTTP 1.1's high level syntax, such as methods, status codes,
                                    header fields, and URIs, the same. The element that is modified is how the data is
                                    framed and transported between the client and the server.</p>
                                <p>The standardisation effort came as an answer to SPDY, an HTTP-compatible protocol
                                    developed by Google. HTTP/2 uses a fixed Huffman code-based header compression
                                    algorithm, instead of SPDY's dynamic stream-based compression. This helps to reduce
                                    the potential for attacks on the protocol.
                                </p>
                                <p>The httpbis working group considered Google's SPDY protocol, Microsoft's HTTP
                                    Speed+Mobility proposal (SPDY based), and Network-Friendly HTTP Upgrade.</p>
                                <p>HTTP/2 is defined for both HTTP URIs (i.e. without encryption) and for HTTPS URIs
                                    (over TLS, where TLS 1.2 or newer is required).</p>
                                <p>Although the standard itself does not require usage of encryption, most client
                                    implementations (Firefox, Chrome) have stated that they will only support HTTP/2
                                    over TLS, which makes encryption de facto mandatory.</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p style="color: #d58753;">Roughly 1.2% of all websites support HTTP/2 till August
                                        2015.</p>

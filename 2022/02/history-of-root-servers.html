                  History of ROOT-SERVERS (A Journey from 4 nodes to 13 nodes at present)
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h6><u>1.1 Period 1983-1986: </u></h6>
                <p>Before the development of DNS, information about hosts were assigned in a flat
                  namespace format and name-to-address look ups was done using table, which use
                  to be available in all the hosts. Network Information Centre (NIC) at SRI
                  International, use to maintain this table and all hosts get the updated copy from
                  SRI-NIC periodically. At that time, most of the hosts were at ARPANET
                  (Advanced Research Project Agency Network) and DND (Defense Data
                  Network), and managing the hosts records in flat file wasn’t that tough.
                  As the number of hosts were increasing so was the size of this flat file, and with
                  the frequency of updates, a decentralized database need was felt. To address this
                  problem, Mr. Jon Postel and Mr. Paul Mockapetris published number of RFCs
                  that laid down the design of DNS.</p>
                <p>To test the DNS, Mr. Jon Postel and Mr. Paul Mockapetris setup the first root
                  server in 1984 at Information Science Institute (ISI) at the University of South
                  California (USC). The domain name services were running of the software
                  developed by Mockapetris, named JEEVES. In 1985 an additional root was added
                  at ISI.</p>
                <p>An additional root server was placed at SRI International, as it was NIC for DDN
                  and was handling the registration of hosts and maintenance of hosts.txt file.</p>
                <p>Doug Kingston and Mike Muuss, at the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) in
                  the U.S. Army, played an important role in the ongoing development of the
                  Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) package. To assist in the further
                  development of the DNS and to provide a root server for MILNET (which was
                  split from the original ARPANET in 1983, is the operational, unclassified
                  network component of the Department of Defense Network) in the event that
                  MILNET had to be disconnected from the ARPANET, BRL volunteered in 1985
                  to host a root server, making it the first root server running BIND on a UNIX
                  operating system</p>
                <h6>Thus by 1985, there were four root name servers<sup><a onclick="linkfiles('link1')">[1]</a>

                  <h6><u>1.2 Period 1986-1990: </u></h6>
                  <p>In October 1986, at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) 6 meeting, Doug
                    Kingston from BRL convened a workshop called “Name Domains for MILNET.”
                    The primary focus was to explore the transition of MILNET to use domain
                    names.<sup><a onclick="linkfiles('link4')">[4]</a></sup></p>
                  <p>During the workshop and also in mailing list discussions afterwards, Gunter Air
                    Force Station was mentioned as a possible root server location because of its
                    ability to serve MILNET. Eventually, in November 1987 GUNTER-ADAM
                    (U.S. Air Force Networking Group) was added as a root server.</p>
                  <p>In 1986, the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) went online. Built
                    as a "network of networks" and developed in phases, NSFNET connected
                    supercomputer centers in the U.S. and a variety of regional research and
                    education networks, extending the Internet’s reach throughout the United States.</p>
                  <p>As NSFNet traffic and registrations grew, people became aware of some
                    cases of poor DNS service due to the limited number and reach of root servers.
                    To address this issue, in July 1987, at the IETF 7 meeting, the name domain
                    planning working group held a one-hour session to discuss root servers.<sup><a
                        onclick="linkfiles('link5')">[5]</a></sup> The goal
                    of the meeting was to select root servers that would provide improved service to
                    the NSFNET.</p>
                  <b>The participants discussed and chose three new name servers –</b>
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>University of Maryland, largely because it was in a position to service
                      equally well the NSFNET, ARPANET, MILNET and SURANET.
                    </li>
                    <li>NASA Ames, because it was an ideal location due to its connection to
                      MILNET, ARPANET, NASA-SCINET19, NSFNET and BARRNET.</li>
                    <li>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), which was part of the New York
                      State Education and Research Network. It was also one of the first
                      Internet service providers in the United States.

                  </ol>
                  <blockquote><span style="color: #d58753;">These three root servers and GUNTER-ADAM were expected to be
                      operational
                      by IETF 8 in November 1987. In November 1987, C.ISI.EDU was retired from
                      root server duty. As agreed, four additional root servers were added.</blockquote>

                  <p>There was an increasing need to have one or more root name servers in Europe
                    to reduce the dependency on the few, expensive and unstable Internet links to the
                    U.S. The issue was a topic of discussion at RIPE 1 on 22 May 1989.<sup><a

                    On 28 July 1991, the server NIC.NORDU.NET was added to the root zone and

                  <p>In 1991, the Defense Information Systems Agency awarded the NIC contract to
                    Government Systems, Inc. (GSI), which in turn outsourced the contract to
                    Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI). As a result, a few changes happened –</p>

                  <p>ince the 1980s, the registration of domain names was performed by the DDN-NIC under contract by the
                    Department of Defense. This was because most
                    registrants at the time were military users and awardees. By the early 1990s, due
                    to the rapid growth of the NSFNET, academic institutions comprised the majority
                    of new registrations, and the military was no longer willing to fund the
                    registration for these names. The U.S. Federal Networking Council (a group of
                    U.S. Government agencies involved in networking) asked the National Science
                    Foundation (NSF) to assume responsibility for non-military Internet registration.</p>
                  <p>In 1992, after a solicitation process (NSF 9224), the NSF awarded three
                    five-year cooperative agreements, to American Telephone and Telegraph
                    Company (AT&T), General Atomics (GA), and Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI).
                    The contracted parties were to provide directory and database services,
                    information services and non-military registration services, respectively. These
                    companies adopted the name InterNIC for their joint role.</p>
                  <p>Around the time Network Solutions won the bid to manage the domain
                    registration service, it asked Jon Postel (IANA) about adding NS.INTERNET.NET as a root name server.
                    Postel agreed and IANA added
                    NS.INTERNET.NET as a root server in April 1993.</p>
                  <p>In May 1994, KAVA.NISC.SRI.COM at SRI International was retired due to lack
                    of funding, and NS1.ISI.EDU was added as a root server to replace it.
                    In 1994, Paul Vixie and Rick Adams asked Jon Postel (IANA) on behalf of the
                    Internet Software Consortium (ISC) to add a root server at ISC. Postel agreed,
                    and in September 1994, IANA added NS.ISC.ORG as a root server. ISC was the
                    organization coordinating the ongoing development and distribution of the most-used name server
                    software, BIND, after taking over responsibility for BIND from
                    Digital Equipment Corporation. </p>

                  <p>By April 1993, the number of root name servers had grown to an extent where
                    the size of a root hints response was approaching the limit of 512 bytes. Bill
                    Manning and Paul Vixie developed a plan to rename all root servers under the
                    root-servers.net domain. This would allow the use of DNS label compression to
                    fit all the names within 512 bytes. Postel (IANA) agreed with the plan and Mark
                    Kosters began the renaming phases in 1995. </p>

                    In January 1997, servers J-Root, K-Root, L-Root and M-Root, were added,
                    serving the root zone exclusively. Postel (IANA) asked Network Solutions Inc.
                    to set up two additional servers with the intention of moving them to suitable
                    operators quickly thereafter. He kept two more servers at USC-ISI with the same
                    intention. J-Root and K-Root were set up at Network Solutions on the U.S. East
                    Coast, while L-Root and M-Root were at USC ISI on the U.S. West Coast. </p>
                  <p>From interviews, it appears that Jon Postel developed and used a few simple
                    criteria in selecting organizations to host these new servers:</p>
                  <ul class="list-type-li">
                    <li> Need: The need for root server service. At the time, Europe had one
                      operator. As the Internet developed in Europe, another root server would be
                      useful. There were also no root servers in Asia, so a root server was needed there.
                      The primary tool that Postel used to determine the need was Larry Landweber’s
                      International Connectivity Map. </li>

                    <li>Connectivity: The potential operator must have good connectivity both to
                      the internal infrastructure (internal connectivity), and to the world (external
                      connectivity). </li>
                    <li> Community consensus: The potential operator should demonstrate the
                      widest possible support from the community being served.</li>
                    <li> Commitment to send and respond to traffic without filtering. The
                      operator must be able to answer every DNS query and send responses back
                      unfiltered. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="blog-tooltip">For the European region, a number of parties expressed their willingness to
                    operate a second root name server. Jon Postel (IANA) encouraged all parties to
                    seek consensus about the matter. After thorough discussion, there was consensus that the Réseaux IP
                    Européens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC) was
                    the appropriate organization to operate the server because of its neutrality and
                    technical expertise. In particular, the RIPE NCC was deemed able to change the
                    server’s deployment following changes in Internet topology.<sup><a href="#">[13]<span
                          class="tooltiptext">
                          At the time, all deployments were unicast. The RIPE DNS working group suggested deploying near
                          or at one
                          of the existing open exchange points. Consequently, the first deployment was at the LINX in
                          London. The
                          LINX contributed hosting and local hands, while the RIPE NCC provided the hardware and covered
                          operations.
                          This choice re-emphasized the independence of the location of the operator and the server
                          itself. This was
                          followed shortly thereafter by deployment of a hot standby at the AMS-IX

                  <p>In the Asia Pacific Region, the Widely Integrated Distributed Environment
                    (WIDE) organization was chosen.</p>
                  <p>These selections provided additional organizational diversity in the operation of
                    root servers. Operators now included educational institutions, governments,

                      optional protocol feature and later mandated by
                      RFC1123. In this scheme, an entire domain name or a list of labels at the end of a domain name is
                      replaced with
                      a pointer to a prior occurrence of the same name in the same message, thus eliminating the
                      repetition of domain
                      names in a message and reducing the size of the message. In the case of responses to root server
                      priming queries
                      , the domain root-servers.net appears only once in the response, instead of 13 times (once for
                      each root server).</a></li>

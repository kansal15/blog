                                    <li><b>Lightweight installation.</b><br>
                                        <p>In this mode, access points make a secure tunnel with the wireless controller
                                            and pass all the user traffic to the controller. Based on configuration,
                                            controller take appropriate actions and process the traffic. Advisable for
                                            large/enterprise setup.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>In this mode, access points play the role of controller also and process the
                                            traffic as per policy. Ideal for small setup.</p>

                                    I roam around at various corner of the floor after connecting to wireless and I
                                    didn’t face any connection drop (or re-authentication issues). This is a roaming
                                    functionality which usually possible only in controller based model. This cause me
                                    believe that wireless setup installed at T3, IGI Airport, New Delhi is controller
                                    based setup.

                                <h6><u>SSID and other information’s –</u></h6>
                                <p>SSID announced at T3 was <b>‘Tata Docomo Wi-Fi’</b> and it was an open ssid (service
                                    set identifier). So, from the name itself it was clearly visible that Wi-Fi service
                                    is provided by Tata Docomo (why will anyone else do the advertisement for Tata
                                    Docomo J).
                                    After connecting to the SSID, all the user traffic is diverted to the captive portal
                                    which asked for OTP based authentication and only after successful authentication,
                                    user is allowed to access the network (Internet).</p>
                                <img src="../../images/igi3.png" alt="igi" class="img-fluid w-50 py-3">

                                <p>From the above screen shots, we are able to find out some useful information like
                                    network segment, signal strength, interference and about 802.11 protocol used.</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>Network</b>- The IP segment used for wireless was 100.77.32.0/20 which
                                        belongs to
                                        100.64.0.0/10 super net which is reserved as <b>‘Shared Address Space’</b> by
                                        IANA
                                        and is described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598"
                                            target="_blank">RFC 6598</a>.</li>

                                    <li><b>802.11 information</b>- I was connected to wireless network over 802.11n
                                        standard
                                        in 2.4 GHz band, over channel number 6 and channel width was 20MHz (.11n
                                        standard
                                        works on both the band i.e., 2.4GHz and 5GHz). Connection speed was 145Mbps
                                        (which
                                        is fairly good) and MCS Index was 15.</li>

                                    <li> <b>Signal strength</b>- RSSI value of the connection was -57dBm, which is
                                        fairly
                                        good as per standards and noise was -96dBM, which is negligible. So, we can
                                        figure
                                        out that interference was very low, or you can say, it was nearly negligible
                                        (and
                                        this was expected because wireless network was confined in the airport, which is
                                        under the reach of limited persons only).

                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>SSID announced for guest access was of <b>web-auth</b> type; means it was open
                                    (anyone can come & connect) and all the user traffic was diverted to the captive
                                    portal, which asked for user authentication through OTP before allowing the user to
                                    access the network.</p>

                                <p>In 802.11 information part, I mentioned that I was connected over 145Mbps, which is a
                                    theoretical connection speed based on Tx power, Rx power, RSSI values, Noise,
                                    Modulation and certain other factors. The actual speed which I measured through
                                    speed test utility is shown below –</p>

                                <p>Speed test results show a download speed of 22 Mbps and upload speed of 32 Mbps which
                                    is much better than the average broadband speed in India.</p>

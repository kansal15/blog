                                    <h6><u>What led to evolution of MIMO? </u></h6>
                                    <p>The main reason for the evolution of MIMO technology is Multipath interference.
                                        Multipath becomes the boon for the evolution of MIMO. Previously, these multiple
                                        paths only served to introduce interference. By using MIMO, these additional
                                        paths can be used to increase the capacity of a link. MIMO utilizes the
                                        multipath signals for the better reception. MIMO increases receiver signal
                                        capturing power by enabling multiple antennas to combine data streams from
                                        different paths (multipath) and at different times<sup><a onclick="linkfiles('link6')">[6]</a></sup>.</p>

                                    <h6>What is Multipath?</h6>
                                    <p>In conventional systems/legacy devices, single transmitter and single receiver
                                        were used (SISO). In this scenario, there is no line of sight between
                                        transmitter and receiver so signal reach receiver after bouncing from obstacles.
                                        So, signal takes multipath. When transmitter sends the data; it spreads out in
                                        all directions and reach the receiver from different paths (multipath) after
                                        getting bounced from walls, ceilings and other obstacles. If the received data
                                        is out- of-sync then they will cancel out each other and null (or no signal)
                                        will be received by receiver for processing. This effect is known as Multipath
                                        interference.</p>

                                    <p>The simplest form of radio link which can be defined in MIMO term is SISO. SISO
                                        (single input, single output) refers to a wireless communications system in
                                        which one antenna is used at the source (transmitter) and one antenna is used at
                                        the destination (receiver). SISO requires no processing in terms of the various
                                        forms of diversity that may be used. However, the SISO channel is limited in its
                                        performance as interference and fading will impact the system more than a MIMO

                                    transmit and receive diversity used in MISO and SIMO systems. Existence of 
                                    multiple antennas in a system means existence of different propagation paths. 
                                    Aiming at improving the reliability of the system, same data is sent across the 
                                    different propagation (spatial) paths. This is called spatial diversity. It is also 
                                    known as switched diversity because antenna with high SNR becomes active 
                                    and processes the data.</p>
                                <p><b>B. Spatial multiplexing - </b>Aiming at improving the data rate of the system, 
                                    we may choose to place different portions of the data on different propagation 
                                    paths. This is called spatial multiplexing. The data chunks received at 
                                    receivers are multiplexed or added to increase the data capacity.</p>

                                        streaming is primarily observed in wireless communications where multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is being used. In a MIMO environment, the 
                                        signal is being transmitted by the various antennas and are multiplexed by 
                                        using different spaces within the same spectral channel. These spaces are 
                                        known as spatial streams or in simple words we can explain it as it is a data 
                                        that has been broken up and sent at the same time over wireless. Wi-Fi is a 
                                        half-duplex connection, which basically means a device, can either send or 
                                        receive but not both at the same time. To speed up throughput 802.11n uses 
                                        multiple radios to send chunks of data at the same time.</p>
                                    <p>In MIMO, each spatial stream is transmitted from a different radio/antenna 
                                        chain in the same frequency channel. The receiver receives each stream on 
                                        each of its identical antenna/radio chain.</p>
                                    <p>As the receiver knows the phase offset of its own antennas, it can use the 
                                        signal processing techniques to mathematically reconstruct the original

                                    <p>Beam forming means pointing antenna array (or group 
                                        of antennas’) for shaping the beam towards a particular direction i.e. to focus 
                                        the energy or beam towards particular physical location especially towards 
                                        client device. Concentrating the energy/signal in one direction improves 
                                        signal to noise ratio and transmit speed.</p>
                                    <p>For reducing the interference and for improving the reliability of wireless 
                                        network, 802.11n and 802.11ac comes with an advanced technology called 
                                        beamforming.</p>
                                    <p>Beamforming transmit the data in the given direction of the client instead of 
                                        radiating in all directions. The best example is laser which can deliver the data 
                                        towards the specific device only while old wireless standards is like a light 
                                        bulb which spreads the light in whole set of area.</p>
                                    <p>To give stronger signal to a specific device, a beamformer (transmitter) 
                                        changes the phase and relative amplitude of the signal.</p>

                                        procedure the physical location of client can be tracked.</p>

                                <h6><u>How Beam forming work?</u></h6>
                                <p>It’s a channel sounding procedure in which a transmitter send a NDP (null 
                                    data packet) announcement frame to the receiver and then the client device 
                                    responds with a matrix indicating how well it heard the signal from each 
                                    antenna. Based on this matrix data, the AP can compute the relative position 
                                    of the client device, and the phase offsets on each of its antennas are required 
                                    to maximize constructive interference at the client device. So, in this way the 
                                    strong signal can be given in right direction and signal will be weaker in other 
                                    direction, which is the way to use of energy in an efficient way.</p>

                                        802.11ac wireless standard. As the name suggest, multiple streams of data are
                                        sent or received between multiple clients at the same time. MU-MIMO is one 
                                        step further in MIMO technology, which enables multiple independent radio 
                                        terminals to access a system, which can provide significant performance gains 
                                        over the original MIMO technology. MIMO provides the facility to multiple

                                        spatial degree of freedom and by adding more antennas/radios, it can control

                                        interference --where the signal is the weakest. With a sufficient number of

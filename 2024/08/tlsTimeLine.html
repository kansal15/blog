                                                SSL v2 is shot down because of serious security issues. Consequently, Netscape scrambles to release SSLv3. 
                                                This protocol seems good enough for now and the golden era of the Web begins. The specification was eventually published as RFC 6101.

                                                the process takes 3 years. TLS v1.0 is published as RFC 2246. Microsoft forces the change of protocol name to Transport Layer Security (TLS),

                                                Even though this problem had been fixed in TLS 1.1 released in 2006 and TLS 1.2 in 2008,
                                                no one actually uses these newer protocol versions. 
                                                Browsers will take about 2 more years to deploy TLS 1.2
                                                and servers many years longer. We have no choice but to rely on browser counter-measures in the meantime. 
                                                BEAST is the first attack to show how rich browser functionality can be abused to attack cryptography
                                                from multiple vantage points. Many similar attacks will follow.

                                                A critical vulnerability in OpenSSL, a very widely used TLS library, is discovered.
                                                If exploited, Heartbleed enables attackers to retrieve process memory from vulnerable servers,
                                                often resulting in private key compromise. Because of tremendous hype associated with the attack,
                                                most public servers fix the vulnerability practically overnight. 
                                                A long tail of vulnerable devices remains, though. 
                                                Heartbleed's biggest contribution is showing the world how severely underfunded the OpenSSL project was in its 20 years of existence. 
                                                In the following months, large organisations start contributing to the project and a big cleanup begins.

                                                It is discovered that SSL v3 doesn't actually have a defence against padding oracle attacks. 
                                                Fortunately, attacks are generally not that easy to carry out and most of the world can use better protocols.
                                                Most sites realise they can turn off this older protocol version without anyone noticing. 
                                                In response to POODLE, browsers stop falling back to SSL v3 on TLS connection failure.

                                                some implementations don't implement them correctly. This new problem is named POODLE TLS.
                                                This discovery shines light on the fact that most protocol implementations aren't tested in adversarial conditions.

                                                Over 1,50,000 certificates issued between March 15 or 16, 2023 will not load due to an incident that happened at sectigo a CT Logger. The migration was mostly successful, except for one rather significant problem: the new log software had been configured with the private key of a test log called "Dodo".<br>
                                                The problem was there for a 20 hour window. Although the CAs should have Sabre's publick key to validate the SCT signature but certificate authorities are prone to sloppiness and shortcut-taking.

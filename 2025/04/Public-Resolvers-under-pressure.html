								DNS is the phone directory of the Internet. We, Humans access the websites (information) through domain name, and System (web browser) fetch the content on behalf of the user through IP address and serve the content to the end user. Domain Name System (DNS) translates the domain names to an IP address. 
								So, If DNS restrict the domain access then user shall not be able to access that domain and that makes the DNS an easy and cheap solution to restrict (and block) the domains/web-portals.

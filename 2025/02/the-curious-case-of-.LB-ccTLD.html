								For nearly thirty years, the domain’s management was led by Mr. Bukhalid. 								 
After the death of Nabil Bukhalid, a former AUB employee, AUB  has made representations to IANA that AUB has no ongoing role or responsibility for the domain and further, AUB has requested to be removed from IANA’s records so that AUB is no longer listed in the IANA database as the manager for .LB. This presents a challenge as IANA does not have a successor organization to appoint in its place. IANA’s current operational procedures and the existing policies on ccTLD transfers assume a qualified successor organization will be available for appointment

					    On 3 February 2008, the Lebanese Council of Ministers issued Decree No. 103/86 and approved a request from the Ministry of Telecom to transfer .LB from AUB to Ogero, a state-owned telecommunications operator. However, Ogero never sought a transfer from IANA and AUB remained the designated manager of the .LB top-level domain.

					    In 2012, the E-Transaction draft law was issued, giving the Ministry of Economy and Trade (MoET) the role of sponsoring the .lb domain registry. As a result, MoET and Mr. Bukhalid reportedly established a formal relationship and updated the .lb top-level domain’s registration policies. In August, Mr. Bukhalid left AUB and informed MoET that AUB would continue hosting the .lb database while he would manage its operations.

					    In February 2013, Fadi Chehadé, ICANN’s then CEO, met with several members of the Lebanese government and 
                                            other Internet stakeholders in Lebanon. Among the topics discussed were the benefits of moving to a bottom-up, 
                                            multistakeholder model of administration for the .LB top-level domain. <br/>
						
					    After a year of discussions, the Lebanese Internet community ratified general bylaws and internal bylaws for 
                                            a not-for-profit association to manage the .lb top-level domain. On 2 June 2014, the Lebanese Internet Center (LINC) 
                                            was established as an association for this purpose at the Ministry of Interior. On 13 June 2014, LINC’s first board 
                                            was elected and it appointed Mr. Bukhalid as its CEO. LINC intended to submit a transfer request to IANA and apply 
                                            for an Arabic-script ccTLD. However, it informed IANA it was ultimately unable to operate in Lebanon due to 
                                            recognition issues within the country under government regulations.

						On 7 June 2020, AUB announced that it would stop hosting .LB’s infrastructure. Mr. Bukhalid consulted with LINC’s Board and the Prime Minister's Office and was directed to work with the Office of the Minister of Administrative Reform (OMSAR) on a plan to transfer the .LB top-level domain to LINC.	
					    </p>
					    <p class="description">
					    On 30 June 2020, AUB, ISOC-LB, and Mr. Bukhalid informed OMSAR of the urgent need to transfer the .LB top-level domain to a multistakeholder entity and relocate .LB’s infrastructure away from AUB.
					    </p>
					    <p class="description">
					    In July 2020, AUB reportedly terminated the contracts of its two employees who had volunteered part of their time to help manage the .LB top-level domain and notified Mr. Bukhalid that they considered him the responsible party for the management of the .LB top-level domain.
					    </p>
					    <p class="description">
					    On 23 September 2020, AUB notified Mr. Bukhalid and OMSAR that it would be decommissioning the services hosted on AUB infrastructure no later than 30 September 2020. Mr. Bukhalid stated he negotiated an extension with AUB to retain some infrastructure until 30 May 2021 and began migrating .LB’s services to a third-party registry service provider, COCCA.
					    </p>
					    <p class="description">
					    On 12 October 2020, the President of the Republic of Lebanon and the Prime Minister gave Mr. Bukhalid exceptional approval for “securing the management and hosting of the Government domain name data with entities that he enters into contractual agreement with on his responsibility, similar to the other (.lb) domain zones.”
					</p>
					<p class="description">
In December 2020, the migration of .LB’s infrastructure to COCCA was completed. AUB retained some infrastructure that was supporting .LB at this time.

					    On 3 January 2023, Mr. Bukhalid passed away unexpectedly and the request to transfer .LB to LBDR LLC was withdrawn.

					    On 7 March 2023, the Minister of State for Administrative Development sent a request to the attention of the General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers regarding the continuity of managing and hosting the data of Lebanese domain names. The request noted that Mr. Bukhalid, a Vice President of ISOC-LB, had managed .LB from its inception until he passed away. It also noted that the circumstances in Lebanon have prevented the establishment of a committee to manage .LB according to the e-transaction law. Given these circumstances, she suggested the extraordinary approval of transferring the duties of managing .LB to Mr. Jacques George Bakaev, the Secretary of ISOC-LB. On 4 May 2023, the Prime Minister of Lebanon approved this request.

					    AUB wrote to IANA again and asked to be removed from the .LB delegation record. In response, IANA explored with ICANN and key community stakeholders how such a request could be implemented in compliance with policies. ICANN approved IANA’s proposal in May subject to some additional engagement with stakeholders.
